# Enhanced VPN Client-Server Communication

This project demonstrates a secure client-server communication setup using SSL/TLS in Java. It includes an EnhancedVPNClient and EnhancedVPNServer.

## Overview

The EnhancedVPNClient connects to the EnhancedVPNServer using SSL/TLS for secure communication. Authentication is handled using username and password credentials stored in configuration files.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

2. Compile Java files:

3. Generate keystore files (if not already generated) using `keytool`:

4. Edit configuration files:
- `client/client.properties`: Configure server address, port, keystore paths, and authentication credentials.
- `server/server.properties`: Configure server port, keystore paths, and authentication credentials.

5. Run the server:

6. Run the client:

## Features

- **SSL/TLS Encryption:** Uses SSLContext to establish secure communication channels.
- **Authentication:** Verifies client credentials using username and password authentication.
- **Multi-threaded Server:** Handles multiple client connections concurrently using a thread pool.

## Usage

1. Start the EnhancedVPNServer on the server machine.
2. Configure the EnhancedVPNClient with server details and authentication credentials.
3. Run the EnhancedVPNClient on client machines to connect securely to the server.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement session management for maintaining client connections.
- Integrate with a database for user management and authentication.
- Enhance security measures with certificate-based authentication.
